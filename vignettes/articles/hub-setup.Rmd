## Create Hub Repository from Template

The first step to setting up a Modeling Hub is to make a copy of the [`hubTemplate`](https://github.com/testorg-original/hubTemplate) GitHub template repository and clone a local copy of it.


## Configure Modeling Hub

Hubs are configured through two JSON config files which are used to validate new submissions as well as inform data users of available data.

- `admin.json`: Contains Hub wide administrative configuration settings
- `tasks.json`: Contains round-specific metadata of modeling tasks including task, target and output type metadata as well as details of submission windows.
These files should live in a directory called `hub-config/` in the root of the Hub repository.


For more details on these files, guidance on how to set them up and access to templates, please see our central [**hubDocs**](https://github.com/testorg-original/hubDocs) as well the [JSON schema](https://github.com/testorg-original/schemas) the config files should adhere to.


## Validate Config files


You can use function `validate_config()` to check whether individual Hub config files are valid. 
To specify the file you want to validate you can either provide the path to the root of the Hub to argument `hub_path` (which assumes the config files are correctly located in directory `hub-config/`) or you can provide a direct path to a config file to argument `config_path`. 
You also need to specify the type of config file through argument `config` (one of `"tasks"` or `"admin"`, defaults to `"tasks"`).

The function will validate a given config file against a specific version of it's schema, specified through argument `schema_version`. The default value of `schema_version` is `"from_config"` which uses the version specified in the `schema_version` property of the config file being validated. 


```{r}
validate_config(
  hub_path = system.file("testhubs/simple/", package = "hubUtils"),
  config = "tasks"
)
```

If validation succeeds, the function returns `TRUE`. The path to the config file validated and the version and URL of the schema used for validation are also attached as attributes `"config_path"`, `"schema_version"` and `"schema_url"` respectively.


You can validate a config file against the latest version of the schema by using `"latest"` or you can choose a specific version, e.g `"v0.0.1"`. 

The function defaults to using stable schema versions released to the `main` branch, but you can choose to validate against another branch (e.g. an upcoming development version) through argument `branch`.

```{r}
validate_config(
  hub_path = system.file("testhubs/simple/", package = "hubUtils"),
  config = "tasks",
  schema_version = "v0.0.0.9"
)
```


```{r}
validate_config(
  hub_path = system.file("testhubs/simple/", package = "hubUtils"),
  config = "tasks",
  schema_version = "latest"
)
```


### Validation returning errors

If validation of the config file fails, the function returns `FALSE`. An additional list dataframe of errors returned by the `ajv` validation engine used is also attached as attribute `"errors"`.


```{r}
config_path <- system.file("error-schema/tasks-errors.json",
  package = "hubUtils"
)
```

```{r}
validate_config(config_path = config_path, config = "tasks")
```

Because the default output of the validator can be unwieldy and difficult to review, you can use function `view_config_val_errors()` to launch a more user friendly and concise version of the errors table in the Viewer panel in Rstudio. 

```{r}
validation <- validate_config(config_path = config_path, config = "tasks")
view_config_val_errors(validation)
```


In the example above: 

- `instancePath` indicates the location of the validation error in the config file.
- `schemaPath` indicates the location of the element in the schema which is failing validation.
- `keyword` indicates the keyword causing the validation error.
- `message` is the validation error message returned by the validator.
- `schema` describes the valid schema values the failing keyword should conform to.
- `data` is the value of the property in the config file which is failing validation.


## Validating all Hub config files

To validate both `admin.json` and `tasks.json` in a single call, you can use function `validate_hub_config()`. 
This functions tests both files for validity and returns a list of the results of the validation checks for each file.
By default it uses "from_config" as the `schema_version` argument and errors if both files are not using the same schema version.

```{r}
validate_hub_config(
  hub_path = system.file("testhubs/simple/", package = "hubUtils")
)
```

You can also use the function to validate a Hub's config against the latest version of the schema.

```{r}
validate_config(
  hub_path = system.file("testhubs/simple/", package = "hubUtils"),
  schema_version = "latest"
)
```

You can also use `view_config_val_errors()` on the output of `validate_hub_config()` to review any detected validation errors.
